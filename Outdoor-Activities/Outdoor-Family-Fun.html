<p>School-age kids will get a kick out of this classic outdoor game that&rsquo;s like tag but played on playground equipment. Start with at least four children, and designate one to be &ldquo;it. &rdquo; the child who is &ldquo;it&rdquo; starts on the ground, counting to 10, while the rest of the kids climb up on the playground equipment. &ldquo;it&rdquo; then tries to tag another player. If &ldquo;it&rdquo; is on the ground, they can keep their eyes open, but if they climb on the equipment, then they have to close their eyes. If &ldquo;it&rdquo; thinks another player is on the ground, they can yell, &ldquo;groundies!&rdquo; and that player becomes &ldquo;it.</p>
