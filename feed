<h3 id="3">Advantages of Kids Outdoor Playground Equipment</h3>
<p>School-age kids will get a kick out of this classic outdoor game that&amp;rsquo;s like tag but played on playground equipment. Start with at least four children, and designate one to be &amp;ldquo;it. &amp;rdquo; the child who is &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; starts on the ground, counting to 10, while the rest of the kids climb up on the playground equipment. &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; then tries to tag another player. If &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; is on the ground, they can keep their eyes open, but if they climb on the equipment, then they have to close their eyes. If &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rdquo; thinks another player is on the ground, they can yell, &amp;ldquo;groundies!&amp;rdquo; and that player becomes &amp;ldquo;it.</p>
<p>Working parents may not always have time to take kids to a local playground, but a playground is a great place for grandparents to take kids from toddlers on up. The advantages of a great playground are that the kids can get fresh air, sunshine, exercise and even interact with some other children. A few tips on playgrounds: be sure the child is dressed appropriately - long pants and sneakers are especially important and will offer protection from scrapes on playground equipment. Remember those burns from slidding on the sliding board with bare skin?.</p>

<p>A question often asked by new gardeners is: &amp;ldquo;can i use mulch, garden soils, or manure as a replacement for potting soil?&amp;rdquo;​ the short answer to this question is no. Garden soil is basically potting soil, but it is made up of worse materials like sand, unfinished compost, and heavier materials. Mulch is composed entirely of raw wood products, and is meant to be placed on top of soil in order to prevent the evaporation of water. This does not work well with flower pots, and is better suited in outdoor gardens and landscaping.</p>
<h2 id="2">Choose the Best Soil for Your Container Garden</h2>
<p>There are many types of potting soils you can choose from, but as you would have guessed, they don&amp;rsquo;t all match up to provide your plants with the best conditions. Apart from being light, having an ability to retain water, having the necessary nutrients, and with the best aeration as mentioned above, here are the other things to look for when looking for the best potting mix for container gardening.</p>
<p>Whether you're growing vegetables, flowers, or herbs in pots, it's important to choose the right kind of soil. Here are tips on choosing the best soil for your container garden, including what to look for and what to avoid. Who has gone to the garden center to start a veggie garden, and been completely flummoxed by all the choices you have to make? containers, soil, seeds or seedlingsso many choices!.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is how to choose the best soil for your container garden. Plants are used to having endless boundaries for their roots in the soil. Unless the soil has structural issues, it will allow for water to flow freely but retain enough moisture that the roots can absorb if they desire. Container soil is limited to a relatively small space and, as such, it needs a few extra items to allow for the proper balance of air pockets, water flow, and water retention.</p>
<p>While it might seem easier to just scoop up some dirt from your yard to put in your containers, this is not a good idea. Garden soil is too dense and could have fungus, microbes, seeds, bugs, or other critters that you don&amp;rsquo;t want in your containers. I also don&amp;rsquo;t recommend buying potting soil with added fertilizer. This is more expensive, and i prefer to add the fertilizer that i choose, that&amp;rsquo;s best for my veggies.</p>
<h3 id="3">Best Container Gardening Soil</h3>
<p>The foxfarm ocean forest is one of the best soil for vegetables for gardeners who are just beginning. It has a well-rounded nutrition and is easy to use. Even more, it is an excellent base choice for many vegetables and plants. This all-natural soil for growing vegetables has an exceptional moisture retention capability and is ideal for both container and pot gardening.</p>
<p>Friends, i'm not going to mince words regarding my recommendations for container gardening soil. Keep these tips in mind and then we'll discuss the best choices for growing your vegetables. Cheaper is not better. You&amp;rsquo;re growing food for your family, after all. Just as you can&amp;rsquo;t grow a healthy body on cheap junk food, you can&amp;rsquo;t grow nutrient-rich vegetables in fill dirt you get free from craigslist, or generic bags of compost with no ingredients listed. And the really cheap potting soil could contain fungus gnats or other critters.</p>
<p>Soil is the foundation for which plants grow. When you are gardening in containers , your plants rely on you, as the gardener, to provide them with the best soil for container gardening for optimal growth. The best soil for container gardening can be attained by layering different types of soils , organic fertilizers , and organic soil amendments.</p>
<p>When beginners consider container gardening they often ask, what is the best soil for container gardening? one of the biggest mistakes that people make when starting their container gardens is not investing in quality potting soil. Think of the potting soil for your container garden as the foundational nourishment those plants will have. Feeding your plants with cheap, non-organic soil from a giant manufacturer is like feeding your body with junk food. It will only get you so far before you start feeling pretty crappy.</p>
<h3 id="4">How much soil do I need?</h3>
<p>The color of soil is one of the few good indicators of the nutrient content it contains. The darker a soil is, the higher the organic material it contains. We must, however, say here that there are a few exceptions, though. Even more, the higher the organic content in the soil for growing vegetables, the more nitrogen it has, and the better its texture.</p>
<p>Gardening trends are just the same as any other fashion. They come and go, new plants and design styles splash onto the scene, along with old favourites that just won't go away. Here are a few to whet your appetite. Roses never go out of fashion they will always be one of the most popular garden plants there are. With new varieties coming out every year it is hard to keep up. A great new collection of fragrant roses has arrived with two in the traditional style white with yellow cores , alister stella grey and big ben and a couple of peach coloured one's coral gem and always you are my favourites.</p>
<p>Since nitrogen nutrient is one of the essential nutrients for vegetables, you must ensure you consider this factor before making a buying decision for your next soil. Additionally, you must also use texture, smell, and color as a guide when choosing the best soil for vegetables. A good soil for growing vegetables is expected to be earthy with no foul whiffs or pongs and should have a bit of sweet smell.</p>
<p>Roses never go out of fashion they will always be one of the most popular garden plants there are. With new varieties coming out every year it is hard to keep up. A great new collection of fragrant roses has arrived with two in the traditional style white with yellow cores , alister stella grey and big ben and a couple of peach coloured one's coral gem and always you are my favourites. Grown in full sun with a fertile soil, roses will always put a smile on your face.</p>
<h3 id="5">My 5 Best Gardening Tips</h3>
<p>Now that you have created the best soil for container gardening, it&amp;rsquo;s time to plant your seeds. Bridget shared some great seed starting tips when growing in containers and grow bags. Moisten the soil before direct sowing so that you do not disrupt the seeds once they are sown. Plant seeds spaced out two times the width or diameter of the seed.</p>
<p>In this video bridget ayers, a backyard gardener in southern california &amp;ndash; zone 10b, shows us how she layers different organic soils, fertilizers, and amendments as part of her container garden planning process to start her seeds. Whether your garden is big or small, make the most of your space with these tips and watch the full best soil for container gardening video on the kellogg garden youtube channel.</p>
<h3 id="6">Read more about Container Gardening</h3>
<p>The best soil for container gardening provides adequate nutrition for plants to use as they need it. As your plants grow, the roots will spread and seek out additional nutrients. You can provide them with what they need to thrive by layering some organic fertilizer into your grow bag midway through. Add a couple of inches of decomposed chicken manure and mix it a bit to incorporate the rich organic matter into the soil. This will release nitrogen slowly into the soil and increases soil fertility.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to grow plants in large containers than small ones. That&amp;rsquo;s because large containers hold more soil, which stays moist longer and resists rapid temperature fluctuations. Small hanging baskets are especially prone to drying out, and during hot summer weather, you may have to water them twice a day to keep plants alive. If your vegetable gardening is limited by insufficient space or an unsuitable area, consider raising fresh, nutritious, homegrown vegetables in containers. A window sill, a patio, a balcony or a doorstep will provide sufficient space for a productive mini-garden. Problems with soilborne diseases, nematodes or poor soil conditions can be easily overcome by switching to a container garden.</p>
<p>Worm castings are a fantastic addition to your soil concoctions. Even if you think you have the best soil for container gardening already, worm castings can make your soil even more robust. When you amend your soil with worm castings, you benefit the soil in many ways. Add minerals and nutrients help deter pests.</p>

Container vegetable gardening is a sure way to introduce children to the joys and rewards of vegetable gardening.</p>
<h3 id="7">How to Grow Cucumbers in Containers</h3>
<p>Make the most of limited garden space and bring your harvest to your porch or patio by growing cucumbers in pots. Container gardening is an easy and less labor-intensive alternative to traditional backyard gardening. Still, it takes a little bit of know-how to yield a plentiful harvest of tender, green, delectable fruits. Check out our tips on growing cucumbers in pots and containers to cultivate a lush container garden this season.</p>
<p>Planting your actual container garden is probably the quickest part of the whole process. Once you have your containers, potting soil, fertilizer, and seeds/seedlings ready to go you are ready to start planting. When it comes to direct sowing some of your seeds like cucumbers, radishes, and lettuce make sure to pay attention to the directions on your seed packet. Your seed packet will tell you how deep and how many seeds to plant, as well as the spacing you will need to thin your seedlings to once they start to grow.</p>
<p>Size matters when growing cucumbers in pots. When growing plants in containers, root systems rely on you to provide them with the moisture and nutrients they need to grow. Cucumbers are heavy feeders and can grow quite large. They require plenty of space and room for roots to spread out. They also need room for supports to be added. Choose a large pot for growing cucumbers.</p>
<p>Most cucumbers, melons, and squashes are not well suited to containers as they are large, sprawling plants. However, bush-type cucumbers and summer squash can be grown in containers. Bush-type cucumber cultivars suitable for containers include &amp;lsquo;spacemaster,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;salad bush,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;pickle bush,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;patio snacker. &amp;rsquo;bush-type summer squash, such as &amp;lsquo;zucchini elite,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;gold rush,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;sunburst,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;patio star,&amp;rsquo; can also be grown in containers.</p>

<p>Growing sweet potatoes in compost how to grow potatoes in grass clippings | no compost grow your own potatoes, in an old compost bag. How to grow potatoes and leeks in the same pot of growing potatoes in a garbage can how to make virtually 'free' organic compost to grow grow potatoes, planting maincrop potatoes in a sack in planting potatoes - back to eden gardening organic.</p>
<p>Yes, you can compost potatoes. Be aware though that potatoes have a tendency to grow into new potatoes if left whole in the compost heap. On one hand, free potatoes! on the other hand, you might not want the plants to be growing there (and growing store-bought potatoes can sometimes introduce disease into your garden)&amp;hellip; chop them up to lessen the risk and if there is any signs of disease (particularly blight), don&amp;rsquo;t compost them in case the virus/spores aren&amp;rsquo;t killed by the composting cycle.</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes are hardy and attract few pests, but these plants do benefit from weed suppression and even a little bit of dressing with compost around the plant once it is growing steadily.</p>
<p>Evening all, i decided to pull out the potato plants that were growing from the scraps berried with the finished compost just to see if there were any potatoes, and to my amazement (considering i did not care for them etc) they produced a good bunch of potatoes (albeit mostly small ish with a few biggies) that i will be having for a potato salad.</p>
<h2 id="2">Is it OK to eat cooked potato skins?</h2>
<p>While you&amp;rsquo;ll find boiled sweets recipes out there, this is advisable since most of those recipes are full off sugar. You&amp;rsquo;ll get all the nutrients you need from the skins and the fiber content that comes from it. Skin is a great source of vitamins and minerals, which is why it should always be peeled. If you peel the cooked sweet potato, you&amp;rsquo;re going to get even more nutrients than if left unpeeled. So, if possible, leave both the peel and skin intact. Also, try to cook sweet potatoe skin before using it in any recipe. Because the cooking process will break down the fibers, making the texture less smooth.</p>
<p>When it comes to cooking potato skins, the secret is to use a relatively high temperature and short cooking times. For some people, only oven-baked will do, while others swear by the air fryer. We think both versions taste pretty great, so we&amp;rsquo;re sharing both recipes, one for the ultimate oven-cooked potato skins, and the other for the ultimate air-fried potato skins. Pick what works for you, and follow our simple, step by step instructions for perfect potato skins every time.</p>
<p>You do not need to peel a sweet potato prior to cooking it in the oven. The skins of sweet potatoes are safe to eat, both raw and cooked, and contain nutrients such as fiber and antioxidants. Leaving the skin on sweet potatoes is a time saver since you don&amp;rsquo;t need to peel them (you do need to scrub them well).</p>
<p>You don&amp;rsquo;t have to peel an entire potato to remove one scab. The scab is a sign of disease in the potato and the disease is caused by one of several species of bacteria named streptomyces. If you eat these scabs, even cooked, then you could get sick. So it is best to cut away the scabs. Commercial potato processors peel away the skins to be safe. Military kitchens also followed the &amp;ldquo;no peel, safer potato&amp;rdquo; approach for over 100 years. Improved agricultural science has reduced the amount of scabbing found on commercially grown potatoes but you should still cut them away when you find them.</p>
<h3 id="3">DON'T Chuck These 12 Items Onto Your Compost Pile</h3>
<p>While the list of what you can compost in your backyard versus a curbside collection organics program may differ slightly, or a lot depending on where you live, the waste hauler, what way the winds are blowing, who&amp;rsquo;s running for president, etc. , some common elements should never be thrown on your compost pile or in your green bin. *the following is by no means written in stone if you have a curbside collection program in your neighborhood, some of the listed items might be accepted by your program, check before you chuck!.</p>
<h2 id="4">5 Things You Should Never Put In Your Compost Pile</h2>
<p>If you put weed, feed and fertilizer on your lawn, be sure to keep those lawn clippings out of the pile. The chemicals and herbicides found in lawn fertilizers can easily be passed on throughout an entire compost pile.</p>
<p>Many people mistakenly put pet waste into their compost. It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to put herbivore pet waste into a compost pile however, keep in mind that it can still be unsanitary. Small amounts of rabbit manure, chicken manure etc. Are commonly placed into compost without any issues. Just keep in mind that it should always be balanced out. ❌ pet waste from carnivorous pets should never be put into the compost pile. Pet waste from herbivores may be placed into compost in reasonable amounts.</p>
<p>Image by bonchan in years past, some people recommended that citrus peels (orange peels, lemon peels, lime peels, etc. ) should not be composted. The reasons given were always unclear and ranged from citrus peels in compost would kill off friendly worms and bugs to the fact that composting citrus peels was simply too much of a pain. We are glad to report that this is absolutely false. Not only can you put citrus peelings in a compost pile, they are good for your compost too.</p>
<p>Growing up, we composted by using a heap. We collected kitchen scraps in a compost pail , and my brothers and i took turns emptying it onto a giant compost pile in the corner of the yard. This heap is also where we put grass clippings and other yard waste. Thirty years later, my parents are still using the same heap! although you might be imagining a compost mountain after so many years, the truth is that the contents biodegrade, keeping the pile a consistent, inconspicuous size.</p>
<h3 id="5">Why are potato skins not good for you?</h3>
<p>You guys. Don't throw the sweet potato skins away. And if you're going to, pretty please send them my way because i want nothing more in this world right now than to eat these sweet potato skin chips. But seriously, i've been throwing these skins away my whole life. I was always a big fan of regular potato skins growing up. You know, with cheese and sour cream, and all the goods.</p>
<p>Boil / by james lewis are boiled potato skins good for you? yes. Eat the skin to capture all the natural nutrition of a russet potato. The potato skin has more nutrients than the interior of the potato. It has lots of fiber, about half of a medium potato&amp;rsquo;s fiber is from the skin. Why are potato skins bad for you? mercer said that skins of potatoes are no worse or better than several other plant foods in their toxicity potential. &amp;ldquo;it can become worse when potatoes turn green from exposure to light. There is a relationship between light and chlorophyll and it does affect the increase of alkaloid, which is poisonous.</p>
<p>Potatoes skins are very good in gardens. They break down and provide potassium for your plants. Plants need potassium for root development, better blooms and to make them more drought tolerant. Wiki user.</p>
<p>These crispy roasted potato skins are exactly what you need to munch on while you prepare the big thanksgiving feast! let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the thanksgiving hangries. It seems like an oxymoron, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? i mean, how could anyone possibly be hungry on a day that revolves around a gigantic feast? but the thanksgiving hangries&amp;nbsp;are a real thing, and i suffer from them almost every year. They always set in during that critical time between everyone showing up at my parent&amp;rsquo;s house and actually sitting down to eat. In my family, everyone strolls in mid-afternoon loaded down with their thanksgiving goodies. The house smells torturously good.</p>
<h3 id="6">Composting Potato Peels: The Do's and Don't's</h3>
<p>Anybody who has a composting bin or compost pile at their house knows that old apple cores, banana peels, and potato skins can be composted. The list of compostable items doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there, in fact, it barely scratches the surface. Yes, each of those items can be composted!</p>
<p>Break apart potato skins into small pieces before composting. If you&amp;rsquo;re composting a large number of potato peels, add only a fraction of the waste to your compost pile at a time. Inspect all potato waste for signs of blight &amp;mdash; unusually brown or purple skin, white mold, decaying tuber flesh, etc. If you&amp;rsquo;re ever unsure about the presence of blight spores, it&amp;rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry! Also visit <a href="http://grantcounselingconnection.com/can-you-compost-potato-peels-for-your-yard/">GrantCounselingConnection</a> for more ideas.</p>
<p>Plan &amp;mdash; buy only the amount of food you need to eliminate waste in the first place. 9. Prep &amp;mdash; do most of your composting during food prep. All those potato peels, green bean stems, and egg shells are great material for compost. Use an extra-large bowl to collect all your food scraps. 8. Green beans &amp;mdash; compost any leftover vegetable if it is not too.</p>
<p>Can composting worms eat potatoes? as a member of the nightshade family, potatoes are relatively high in solanine. So, it should come as no surprise that compost worms avoid the potato peels they're served. However, like all organic matter, potatoes will eventually break down and become transformed. A red worm is an earthworm used in composting food scraps and other organic material and as fishing baits while a nightcrawler is a large earthworm found on the soil surface at night and used for fish bait. Thus, this explains the main difference between red worms and nightcrawlers.</p>
<h3 id="7">What do I do with these potatoes growing out of my compost</h3>
<p>I was turning the compost yesterday, after having ignored it for most of the summer, and in addition to discovering that it really needed some water added to it, i discovered that there were baby potatoes buried among the old coffee grounds and half-rotten bread and mushy tomatoes. Is it ok to eat potatoes that are growing in unfinished compost? i mixed them back into the pile, but it occurred to me later that maybe if i washed them first, that it wouldn't hurt to eat them.</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes like warmth and crop best at temperatures of 21&amp;ndash;26&amp;deg;c (70&amp;ndash;80&amp;deg;f),&amp;nbsp;so are ideal for growing in a greenhouse, either in large tubs, growing bags or a greenhouse border. Transplant&amp;nbsp;them from their pots once they have plenty of roots. The trailing&amp;nbsp;stems can be trained up strings, canes or trellis to save space. When growing in containers, any&amp;nbsp;good-quality compost&amp;nbsp;should be suitable, including peat-free.</p>
<p>I am just about to start harvesting my charlotte potatoes. I would like to know what the used growing medium can be used for. Can i use it to grow more potatoes the original compost was half peat free and plenty of well rotted manure you grow it; i'l tell you how to cook it tags: none 19-07-2010, 12:29 pm it isn't usually recommended to re-use potato compost for potatoes again because of introducing viruses etc and, of course, the same nutrients will be used for the following on crop, which would be looking for food already taken. Professional potato growers have to re-use their fields but then, they spray and feed the ground.</p>
<p>Image by griffin24 potato plants are heavy feeders, so it&amp;rsquo;s only natural to wonder if growing potatoes in compost is feasible. Organic-rich compost supplies much of the nutrients potato plants need to grow and produce tubers, but is pure compost too rich? will they grow too leggy with reduced yields? let&amp;rsquo;s find out.</p>
<h3 id="8">Can Potatoes Go In Compost : Potatoes</h3>
<p>Are you sure you gave them enough water? i water mine a minimum of once a day with loads of water, and now the sun is out twice a day. Once first thing in the morning, and once in the late afternoon or evening. I give them a really good drenching to make sure the compost is moist all the way through, and they seem to be thriving. I have no idea how many potatoes i'll get out of this experiment, or whether i'll have saved money. But its great fun, and i'm looking forward to proper tasty home grown organic spuds!.</p>
<p>Plant sweet potatoes in warm soil about a month after the last spring frost. Space sweet potato plants 12 to 18 inches apart in damp, loamy soil with a ph of 5. 8 to 6. 2. Before planting, improve your native soil by mixing in several inches of aged compost or other rich organic matter. Protect young potato plants from weeds by inspecting your garden bed often and gently removing any weeds by hand.</p>
<p>By russell it can be pretty hard for beginners to manage a compost pile at their residence. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a big garden, you can use compost bins to organize the stack. There are quite a few methods that can be used to start a compost pile. Most people like to use the cold composting process because of its ease. In this method, you just make a pile of all your greens and browns and then continue the decomposition process. There are quite a few different things that you can add to your compost mix. Several people have been asking whether or not it is possible to use potatoes in your compost pile.</p>
<p>That is, potatoes roasted in layers of food scraps. Yum? there is a recipe in chef jos&amp;eacute; andr&amp;eacute;s' new cookbook, vegetables unleashed , that's a bit of a head-scratcher. Titled 'compost potatoes,' it goes something like this: layer used coffee grounds in a baking pan. Nestle the potatoes into the grounds. Then dump the contents of your compost bin on top. Roast for an hour at 400 f.</p>
<h3 id="9">Can I freeze baked potatoes?</h3>
<p>Yes they sure can! if i am making a recipe that needs cooked potatoes (like loaded mashed potato cakes or twice baked potato casserole ) i simply bake the potatoes and scoop out the flesh. Freeze the empty shells on a baking pan and then once frozen, stack them in a freezer bag. They&amp;rsquo;ll keep for several months in the freezer. Bake these easy potato skins starting right from frozen, no need to defrost first!.</p>
<p>Prevtesting10 march 2022 try not to overcrowd the baking sheet, as fries need to bake evenly. 8,790 micrograms of beta-carotene. Take out the dish and stir the sweetpotatoes every 5 minutes after the first 20 minutes to check doneness. Do this for 5-10 minutes. Add the beef, the remaining garlic, 1 teaspoon of the soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of the sesame oil. Heat olive oil in a large pan. Cook until floating, then transfer to cold water. When boiling, put 300g of glass noodles and add a little bit of vegetable oil (optional). The important thing is that all the chunks are almost at the same size for them to be evenly cooked.</p>
<p>Do baked potatoes go bad after leaving the freezer? unfortunately, yes! baked potatoes that have been defrosted in the refrigerator can be kept for an additional 3-4 days before cooking. But those that have been defrosted in the microwave or cold water should be eaten right away.</p>
<p>Make the potatoes according to your recipe, then let cool completely, wrap individually in foil or plastic wrap, place in an airtight freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months. You can thaw twice-baked potatoes in the refrigerator or reheat them from frozen in the oven or microwave.</p>
<h3 id="10">How do you eat potato skins?</h3>
<p>Potato peels, like onion skins, can be thin enough to slip between the blades. Potato peels in garbage disposal could fall through if they aren&amp;rsquo;t finely chopped. This creates a blockage in the sink trap, which could result in a clog.</p>
<p>In a dutch oven or a large, wide pot, add the oil and heat over medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers 350 degrees f. Fry the potato skins in the hot oil until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with clean paper towels to drain the excess oil. Sprinkle on some salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Walkers is repurposing potato waste as fertiliser uk crisp brand walkers is hoping to reduce its carbon emissions by up to 70% by repurposing its waste potato skins and combining them with co2 from beer production to create fertiliser for potato crops. The brand has installed an anaerobic digester at its factory, which feeds potato waste to bacteria. The resulting methane gas is captured and used to produce the electricity needed to run the factory&amp;rsquo;s crisp frying machines.</p>
<p>Making a potato skin appetizer is a great way to use those leftover skins. You can create some pretty amazing dishes, too. Try some of these ideas: gooey cheese potato skins &amp;ndash; cut the leftovers into rounds and arrange them on a baking sheet. Spoon a bit of shredded cheddar cheese onto each, fold the edges up around the cheese and bake until the cheese melts.</p>
<h3 id="11">Can you freeze potato peelings?</h3>
<p>By louisa on 9 dec 2009 | 15 i came across the recipe the other day and thought mmm &amp;ndash; potato crisps made from potato peelings rather than the potato themselves &amp;ndash; the skin contains loads of fibre and it&amp;rsquo;s usually the tastiest bit of the &amp;lsquo;tato too, so win all around. Our potato peelings usually end up in the stock box in the freezer &amp;ndash; although when we finally get chickens, they might end up in their treat bucket instead (there seems to be some disagreement about whether you can feed chickens raw potato &amp;ndash; some say yes, some say no, although everyone says don&amp;rsquo;t feed them green bits).</p>
<p>Now, they are noshing on rotting banana peels, bell pepper trims, plate scraps that the cats won&amp;rsquo;t eat. I froze a big batch of potato peelings for this photo session. I thawed the peelings overnight and delivered lunch to the worm bins!&amp;nbsp; a new package of carrot and potato peels are in the freezer for the next time. In summer a cold pack of frozen peels can be good for the worm bin. (more about that in a later post).</p>
<p>It&amp;rsquo;s tailgating season! if you are looking for something new and different with minimal effort, here is the recipe for you! these easy potato peel chips are so easy, you will kick yourself for ever throwing away those peelings! we use potatoes a lot! so i sometimes feel like i am always peeling potatoes. My friends refer to me as slightly crunchy. What that means is, i don&amp;rsquo;t like wasting food and am always looking for ways to use and reuse things i cook with. I am a huge proponent of making broth with chicken bones and you may or may not be able to find an eerie little bag in my freezer full of chicken bones.</p>
<p>Wash your potatoes, peel them, and use the potatoes as you had planned to use them anyway. Put the peelings into your pressure cooker along with a bay leaf or two, and a few cloves of garlic. No need to salt or season further -- in fact, it's best if you don't, for maximum flexibility later. Use enough water to cover the peelings, then about 500 ml (2 cups) more. Remember, it's best to keep the stock concentrated so that it takes up less room in the freezer -- why dilute with tons of water that will just take up freezer space.</p>
<h3 id="12">How do you compost potato peels?</h3>
<p>Wash your vegetables thoroughly for cooking and collect the peels in a small bucket. Corn husks, kale leaves, winter squash shells, potato and carrot peels, edible stems, and seeds of vegetable e. T. C all make excellent compost.</p>
<p>As a member of the nightshade family, potatoes are relatively high in solanine. So, it should come as no surprise that compost worms avoid the potato peels they&amp;rsquo;re served. However, like all organic matter, potatoes will eventually break down and become transformed.</p>
<p>Are you someone who peels every vegetable, regardless of how you are going to be cooking it? or do you do it out of habit, reaching for the peeler on auto pilot? peeling vegetables (and many fruits) is a waste of food, time, money, fiber and nutrients. In fact, peeling vegetables contributes a huge amount of unnecessary waste to our landfills and compost bins every year. You may not think those few potato skins make a difference, but collectively in new zealand we throw away 13,658 tonnes of vegetables peelings and 986 tonnes of fruit peelings every year.</p>
<p>Place the saucepan on the stove. Switch on and set on medium flame. Add water and let it boil for 3-5 minutes. Once the water is lukewarm add potato peels in the saucepan and close the lid. Boil the peels in the water for 30-35 minutes. Turn off the flame and let the peels stay in water for another 15-20 minutes. Using a strainer or a clean cotton cloth strain the water into a bowl. Squeeze the juices well from the peel and then discard them or add to your compost.</p>
<h3 id="13">Are potato skins dirty?</h3>
<p>Be aware that there may be pesticides in potato skins. The usda found 70 percent of the food tested in 2019 had pesticide residue, which is a possible human carcinogen. Potatoes were discovered to be in the top 12 list , known as "ewg's dirty dozen. "a 2019 study, published in environmental research , found that eating organic produce for only six days caused an average of 60 percent reduction in the levels of synthetic pesticides measured in the subjects' urine, compared to eating a conventional diet.</p>
<p>No. People often peel potatoes, which does help reduce the pesticide levels of this root vegetable member of the dirty dozen. The only problem is that the potato skins hold most of the nutrients, including fiber, potassium, and vitamin c. To get the most nutrients without the pesticides, opt for organic potatoes.</p>
<p>Shutterstock this is all great news, and we're more than happy to ditch the laborious task of peeling anyway, but a bonus of saving your potato skins is that they can taste amazingly good! a baked potato 's skin that's been salted and crisped to perfection is a revelation. Leaving the thin, wispy skins on mashed yukon golds adds a rustic, delicious touch of charm and can cure all your comfort food cravings. And don't forget skin-on sweet potato nachos topped with ground turkey and fresh veggies. So what if the skin can be odd-looking and sometimes covered in dirt? okay, no one wants to eat funny-looking, dirty potatoes.</p>
<h3 id="14">50 THINGS YOU CAN COMPOST</h3>
<p>How can i get a compost bin? they are available to buy at local garden centres and diy stores or online. Also why not use up some timber or wood and build your own composter. Just look online and instructions can be found on how to build it. How can i stop the swarm of flies that comes out every time i take the lid off my compost bin?.</p>
<p>Select location: you will need to find a decent location for your compost pile. Try to pick a location that is not in direct sunlight as it will dry out the compost pile relatively quickly. Also remember that your compost pile is not the greatest thing to look at so try to find a place that is out of the way like the back or corner of the garden.</p>
<p>The field trial was conducted during the summer in 2018 in mcallen, tx in the rio grande valley (26. 2034&amp;deg; n, 98. 2300&amp;deg; w). The field site was located in an isolated area inside the mcallen composting facility previously used as a vegetable garden. Prior to the present study, the site had been under fallow for the past 3 years. In mcallen during the summer of 2018, the mean high temperature during the summer months is 40. 25&amp;deg;c with irregular rain patterns. Figure 1 shows average temperature and precipitation levels for summer 2018. The soil is classified as brennan fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic aridic haplustalfs, usda soil classification, nrcs web soil survey) with 74% sand, 14% silt, and 12% clay.</p>
<p>If you finish a piece of fruit, wait to discard it in the nearest trash can. Or, better yet, compost it. &amp;ldquo;composting is better [for the environment] and so easy,&amp;rdquo; she says. All you have to do is get a compost bin for your backyard, fill it up about halfway with dead leaves, and start collecting your food waste. Sherman keeps a plastic shoebox or two in her freezer to collect any fruit or vegetable residue, and when the shoeboxes become full, she makes a hole in the leaves outside in the compost bin, tosses the frozen waste in, and covers it with the leaves.</p>
<p>Aerobic bacteria, the workhorses of decomposition, need carbon and nitrogen to do their job. Experts recommend a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of 25:1 to 30:1 for the fastest breakdown of materials; however, the numbers just need to be in the ballpark. The general rule is to have enough greens for your browns. Typically, green, fresh, and colorful debris provides a good source of nitrogen. Coffee grounds are an exception; they are full of nitrogen. Other browns and beiges&amp;mdash;chopped-up autumn leaves and twigs, wood chips, and straw&amp;mdash;provide carbon. Although a pile of autumn leaves will eventually break down on its own, adding some high-nitrogen lawn clippings, vegetable scraps, and coffee grounds will speed things along.</p>
<p>Most home gardeners have more browns than greens, unless they bring in some manure or have a cow in the back yard. Most of the stuff you collect in fall and spring are browns. Based on the above discussions, too much brown results in a slow composting process. There is a simple solution to this problem. The problem with too much browns is that the there is not enough nitrogen for all of the carbon. A very simple solution is to add some nitrogen fertilizer to the compost pile. Adding a handful of urea to a pile of leaves will speed up the process.</p>

<h2 id="2">LED Grow Lights vs. Sunlight</h2>
<p>When selecting the ideal lighting system, growers must keep in mind that cannabis needs full-spectrum lighting to grow well. Full-spectrum lighting is light from a source that contains the entire electromagnetic spectrum and includes wavelengths that range from 400nm to 720nm. This specific spectral wavelength range is also what activates par (photosynthetically active radiation), which is a biochemical process in plants that is necessary for growth. As such, light from near-ultraviolet to infrared is essential and necessary for growing cannabis plants as well as all other plants. Full-spectrum lighting closely mimics sunlight, which is the ultimate source of full-spectrum light.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, a led grow light would replicate the spectrum that our sun produces while allowing us to adjust the intensity of the light to the exact needs of the cannabis plant. This would truly be called full spectrum grow lights. Natural sunlight is very evenly spread and its wavelengths peak in the par spectrum. Cannabis plants are able to put to use light wavelengths outside of the par spectrum, but the light is generally too powerful or too weak to support primary photosynthesis.</p>
<p>The sun produces white light, and plants do best when they receive all colors of the visible spectrum, so it seems reasonable to conclude that the best led lights are white lights. And many manufacturers try to convince customers that this is true with comments such as: &amp;ldquo;our led provides the optimal full spectrum which provides plants, veg and flowers in all stages of growth with everything they need from natural sunlight&amp;rdquo;.</p>
<p>Far have we come from the days of relying exclusively upon natural sunlight as our only source of grow light- today&amp;rsquo;s technology equips the modern gardener with led grow lights! whether you are aspiring home growers or hardened veterans, grow light kits come in all sorts of variations that cater towards excelling in growing specific plants. In short- they are exactly what a successful grower needs to succeed in any environment. Here we will take a look at the cream of the top- 1000w grow light products.

Use these steps to use the proper grow lights when growing plants indoors.</p>
<p>Plants set up indoors rely on full-spectrum lighting. The most common types of lights used include hps, which stands for high-pressure sodium, mh, which stands for metal halide, and led lights, which refer to light-emitting diode lights. Mh lights are whiter than hps lights and have been used in the growing of cannabis for a long time. However, nowadays, hps is considered a new mh.</p>
<p>Led stands for light emitting diode. They are an energy efficient type of grow light with many styles and uses. Led grow lights are specially designed to emit the right kind of light for growing plants indoors.

<h3 id="14">Do I need a special light to grow plants indoors?</h3>
<p>Some plants may need artificial lighting to be able to grow well indoors, but not that many. During the winter (in temperate climates) it can be pretty light-less all day and maybe only 7 hours daylight (never mind sunshine), so you may have to provide artificial lighting, especially for those that need up to 12 hours a day. Using artificial lighting is an ideal way to grow in a room without windows, and for propagating plants.</p>
<p>Utilizing artificial light for growing plants indoors can be beneficial any time of year, especially for plants that don't have prime real estate near a sunny window. However, growing plants indoors can become infinitely more difficult in the winter when the days are shorter and the air may be a heck of a lot colder (so you may want to move your plants away from windowsills).
